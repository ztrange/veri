### 📊 Metrics — issue 1898

Wall time for the issue: 764 s, from the last `resume`, or the first event of the log when there is none, to the mark that ended the run.
Seconds the machine was not running inside that span: 0 s, excluded from it.
Steps done: 1 of 1 planned.
Outcome: the run landed — its draft PR is https://github.com/ztrange/veri/pull/2002.
Cost is every leaf of the run, and the conductor own spending is not in it: this log carries no usage record of the conductor own.
Models requested: VERI_MODEL unset, VERI_MODEL_DEVELOPER unset, VERI_MODEL_VERIFIER sonnet, VERI_MODEL_REVISE opus; models that answered: claude-sonnet-5-5.

The figure comparable across runs is turns, the same measurement on any model; dollars are not comparable, the same measurement only at the same VERI_MODEL, VERI_MODEL_DEVELOPER, VERI_MODEL_VERIFIER and VERI_MODEL_REVISE.

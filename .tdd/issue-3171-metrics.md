### 📊 Metrics — issue 3171

Wall time for the issue: 1152 s, from the last `resume`, or the first event of the log when there is none, to the mark that ended the run.
Seconds the machine was not running inside that span: 1 s, excluded from it.
Steps done: 1 of 1 planned.
Outcome: the run landed — its draft PR is https://github.com/ztrange/veri/pull/3200.
Lane: ready-for-agent:mu
Cost is every leaf of the run, and the conductor own spending is not in it: this log carries no usage record of the conductor own.
Models requested: VERI_MODEL unset, VERI_MODEL_DEVELOPER unset, VERI_MODEL_VERIFIER sonnet, VERI_MODEL_REVISE unset; models that answered: claude-sonnet-5-5.

| skill-edit step for the unit `skills/vgroom/SKILL.md`: during triage `/vgroom` finds every open or closed issue titled `PRD <nnn>.<k>: …` with no GitHub parent, sets its parent to the issue titled `PRD <nnn>: …` through the sub-issues API and reports each one it set, reports and leaves an issue whose parent is a different issue, and reports a PRD number with no PRD issue and sets nothing, meeting requirement GR12 ⟦skill-edit⟧ ⟦criterion 1⟧ | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 51 | 7 | 14 | 6470 | 54324 | 42277 | 0.18 | 93 | unknown | unknown | unknown |  |  | full |

The figure comparable across runs is turns, the same measurement on any model; dollars are not comparable, the same measurement only at the same VERI_MODEL, VERI_MODEL_DEVELOPER, VERI_MODEL_VERIFIER and VERI_MODEL_REVISE.

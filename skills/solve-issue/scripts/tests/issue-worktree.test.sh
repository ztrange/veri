# Unit tests for scripts/issue-worktree.sh — the linked git worktree an issue branch lives
# in, so a conductor never drags the checkout it was invoked from off the default branch
# (issue #43).
#
# Contract under test:
#   issue-worktree.sh <n> <slug>   creates/reuses <repo-root>/.tdd/wt/<n> on branch
#                                  tdd/<n>-<slug>, prints its absolute path, exit 0
#
# Everything is asserted against a throwaway `git init` repo with one commit — worktrees
# need a commit to check out — and through git's own answers (`worktree list`, `rev-parse`)
# rather than by looking at the directory, because a plain `mkdir` would pass the latter.

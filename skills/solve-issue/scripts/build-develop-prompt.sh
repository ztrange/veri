# build-develop-prompt.sh — assemble a DEVELOPER leaf's prompt for one cycle phase.
#
# The mirror of build-verify-prompt.sh, and its opposite in emphasis: the verifier builder
# is defined by what it cannot carry (no rationale parameter, so blindness is structural),
# this one by what it must carry. Every run of a phase sends the same instructions from a
# versioned template; the conductor supplies only the variables. That is what removes the
# run-to-run variance of a prompt improvised from prose each cycle.
#
# Usage:
#   build-develop-prompt.sh red <issue-spec-file> <step-text> <test-cmd>
#
# Prints the assembled prompt on stdout (feed it to supervise.sh). Exit 2 on an unknown
# phase or a missing template/spec file — never a partial prompt.

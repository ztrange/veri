# Unit tests for docs/build-walkthrough.py — the guards that keep the generated
# walkthrough honest. Zero-dependency plain-shell asserts, same idiom as the
# scripts/tests/*.test.sh suites.
#
# The walkthrough is generated: its code half is read from the real scripts, and its
# prose half lives in docs/wt/commentary.py keyed by line range. Three guards stop that
# arrangement failing silently, and each one exists because the failure actually
# happened during authoring:
#
#   1. coverage    — a script's chunks must cover lines 1..N exactly once. Without it,
#                    adding a line to a script detaches the commentary with no signal.
#   2. unknown ref — {{p-id|…}} must name a real reference entry, or the page ships a
#                    dead tooltip.
#   3. expansion   — no {{ref}} may survive into the output. The original matcher used
#                    [^}]* for display text, which silently failed on bash display like
#                    {{p-pipe|"${PIPESTATUS[0]}"}} and truncated {{p-default|${VAR:-default}}}
#                    to "${VAR:-default" — four dead refs and five corrupted ones.
#
# A guard that has never been seen to fire is decoration, so every case below breaks the
# thing on purpose and asserts the build refuses.
#
# Each case runs against a disposable copy of the tree, so the real repo is never
# mutated even if a case aborts.

#    `local` inside a function is visible to everything it then calls — bash scopes
